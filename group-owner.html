<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This section describes how a PI or other owner of an OMERO group can manage the group for their laboratory.</p>

<p>The server administrator must assign the lab PI as the group owner. Then as group owner, the PI can add other users to the group and, if desired, assign others in the lab as group owners as well.</p>

<p>Most lab groups are set up with Read-annotate permissions. This allows members of the group to:</p>

<ul class="bullet-list">

<li>view data other members have placed in the group</li>

<li>add tags, key-value pairs, attachments, ratings and comments to data in the group</li>

<li>adjust and save rendering settings under their own name</li>

<li>draw and save ROIs on the images</li>

<li>use the data in analysis and figures.</li>

</ul>

<p>In addition to the other interactions, group owners can:</p>

<ul class="bullet-list">

<li>change the permissions level of the group (except for promoting to Read-write, which is an admin privilege)</li>

<li>import data for other users in the group</li>

<li>delete or move the data belonging to any members of the group</li>

<li>using the Command Line Interface, change the owner of the data, for example if the original owner has left the lab.</li>

</ul>

<p>Details of the Command Line Interface <a href="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero/users/cli/index.html" target="_blank" class="external-url">OMERO.cli</a> are in the OME documentation.</p>

<p>Details on accessing OMERO with the OMERO.web client are in the Using the <a href="http://help.openmicroscopy.org/web-client.html" target="_blank" class="external-url">OMERO.web Client</a> section of User Help.</p>

<p class="note-title">Note</p>
<p class="note-text">If permissions are reduced to Private when one member has created output from another member's image in the group using a script, e.g. made a projection, the permissions change will fail.</p>

<h2>Default groups</h2>

<p>A user who is a member of more than one group can set any group as their default group. This group will be then shown in the data tree each time they log in. For details on how users can change their default group see Changing your default group in the <a href="http://help.openmicroscopy.org/sharing-data.html#default" target="_blank" class="external-url">Sharing Data</a> section of User Help.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="important"></a>Important Notes:</h2>

<p>The OMERO.dropbox system is designed for images or filesets to be copied in at normal acquisition rates. Copying large numbers of files en masse may result in files failing to import.</p>

<p>Multi-file formats will be imported after the last required file of a set is copied into the directory.</p>

<p>There is a built-in delay of 60 seconds between your dropping the files into a folder in the dropbox and the processing beginning. This is to allow any additional files that may be part of a multi-file data set to be added. Be patient!</p>

<p>OMERO.dropbox is designed as a blind system to enable quick and easy upload of files. There is no feedback to the user in the system. You will not be notified of success or failure of imports done through dropbox.</p>

<p>There is no user configurability, if you have issues or problems, speak to your OMERO server administrator.</p>
