<p>
    OMERO.dropbox is designed to enable automated import of files that are
    placed in a monitored folder.
</p>

    <p>OMERO.dropbox will:</p>
    <ul class="bullet-list">

        <li>only import files that are recognised by OMERO as being valid
            import formats</li>

        <li>import any recognised associated files such as log files dropped
            into the folder.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The OMERO.dropbox system must be set-up by the OMERO server
        administrator and there are some limitations on the types of drives it
        can be set up on. You will need to speak to your OMERO administrator
        to be added to the OMERO.dropbox system.
    </p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" id="important"></a>Important Notes:</h2>

    <p>
        The OMERO.dropbox system is designed for images or filesets to be
        copied in at normal acquisition rates. Copying large numbers of files
        en masse may result in files failing to import.
    </p>

    <p>
        Multi-file formats will be imported after the last required file of a
        set is copied into the directory.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is a built-in delay of 60 seconds between your dropping the
        files into a folder in the dropbox and the processing beginning. This
        is to allow any additional files that may be part of a multi-file data
        set to be added. Be patient!
    </p>

    <p>
        OMERO.dropbox is designed as a blind system to enable quick and easy
        upload of files. There is no feedback to the user in the system. You
        will not be notified of success or failure of imports done through
        dropbox.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is no user configurability, if you have issues or problems,
        speak to your OMERO server administrator.
