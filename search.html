<p>
OMERO has a text-based search feature which allows you to search for data by name or other text associated with the data.
Other fields include description or annotations on the data such as Tags, Comments and Text-based File attachments.
</p>

<p>The search functionality is identical in both the OMERO.insight and OMERO.web clients. The following steps can be applied to either client.</p>

<div class="line-block">

</div> <!-- end #line-block -->

<ol class="step">

<li>
<p class="first">
    Start a search by typing text into the search box at the top right of the window.
    Hit Enter to search. You will be taken to the main search page and the results will be dispalyed.
</p>

<p>You can also go directly to the main search in OMERO.insight by opening the Search pane at the left.</p>

</li>


<li>
    <p>
        Once you are on the main search page, you can refine your search in a number of ways.
        Use <span class="bold">Wildcards</span> to broaden your search.
    </p>

    <p> -
        Use an asterisk <span class="bold">*</span> as a multi-character wildcard, either at the end of a word or the beginning
        E.g. mito* will match mitosis and mitochondria. *phase will match metaphase, anaphase, telophase etc.
    </p>

    <p> -
        Use a question mark <span class="bold">?</span> as a single-character wildcard. E.g. Aurora? will match AuroraA or AuroraB.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <p>
        Use the <span class="bold">AND</span> keyword to ensure that all results contain all keywords. E.g. GFP AND H2B will
        only return results that contain both GFP and H2B. Simply searching for GFP H2B will return results that contain
        GFP or H2B, although items that contain both will be ranked higher in the search results.
