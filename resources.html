<p>It is convenient to put together material for OMERO training sessions from some of the resources and PDFs available on the website.</p>

<p>We suggest using an A5 &#39;Getting Started with OMERO&#39; brochure which can be customised with your institution's server details. Generic UK and USA versions are in the downloads folder <a href="http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/help/resources/a5-brochure/" target="_blank">a5-brochure</a>, as Word&reg; Docs for editing, or as generic PDFs.</p>

<p>This generally helps the participants in the training session to get started and logged in with minimal confusion.</p>

<p>You can also select appropriate sections in the User Help website, and download the individual PDFs of the pages using the link at the top right of each page. These have been formatted for printing.</p>

<p>Alternatively all the PDFs available for both OMERO versions can be downloaded as a zip archive using the links below.</p>

<ul>

  <li>All User Guides for <a href="http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/help/archives/OMERO_User_Guides_5_1_0.zip">Version 5.1.0</a> (Zipped PDF 185 MB)</li>
  <br/>

  <li>All User Guides for <a href="http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/help/archives/OMERO_User_Guides_4_4_12.zip">Version 4.4.12</a> (Zipped PDF 186 MB)</li>
  <br/>

</ul>
  
<p>For users in the University of Dundee College of Life Sciences, there are some pages aimed specifically at users of Nightshade, the CLS OMERO server.</p>

<ul>

  <li>CLS Nightshade <a href="http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/help/pdfs/cls-public.pdf" target="_blank">Public Sharing Instructions</a> and <a href="http://help.openmicroscopy.org/cls-public-demo.html" target="_blank">Demo Site</a></li>
  <br/>

</ul>
